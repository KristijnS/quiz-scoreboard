### Ex Aequo Tiebreaker System

A complete tiebreaker mechanism for handling tied scores:

#### Quiz Setup
- **Ex Aequo Toggle**: New checkbox in Quiz Management to enable/disable the Ex Aequo round
- **Target Value**: Configurable numeric target value that teams try to guess
- **Visual Indicator**: Balance scale icon (‚öñÔ∏è) clearly marks the Ex Aequo setting
- **Automatic Round Creation**: Enabling Ex Aequo automatically creates a special round with unlimited score capacity (999999 points)

#### Round Management
- **Locked Position**: Ex Aequo round is always positioned last and cannot be moved
- **Protected from Editing**: Ex Aequo round name and max score cannot be modified
- **Smart Insertion**: New rounds automatically insert before the Ex Aequo round
- **Disabled Controls**: Edit and arrow buttons are disabled for Ex Aequo rounds to prevent accidental modifications

#### Ranking Logic
- **Excluded from Totals**: Ex Aequo scores do not count toward team total scores
- **Tiebreaker Only**: Ex Aequo values are only used when teams have identical total scores
- **Closest Wins**: When tied, the team with the answer closest to the target value ranks higher
- **Mathematical Precision**: Uses `Math.abs(teamAnswer - targetValue)` to determine proximity

#### UI Integration
- **Scoreboard**: Displays rankings with Ex Aequo tiebreaking applied
- **Leaderboard**: Animated reveal respects tiebreaker order
- **Top 5 View**: Progressive reveal honors tiebreaker rankings
- **Chart View**: Visual rankings reflect tiebreaker logic
